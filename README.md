# Conway's Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life implementation in Python, with customizable initial patterns and interactive gameplay.
Game of Life in Python
This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python. The game is a classic example of a cellular automaton, where the state of each cell is determined by its neighbors in a grid. The game follows simple rules, but can produce complex and interesting patterns.

Usage
To use the program, run main() in a Python interpreter. The program will ask you to choose one of three initial patterns to start the game. You can then choose to see the next pattern or end the game.

Requirements
The program requires Python 3 to run.
